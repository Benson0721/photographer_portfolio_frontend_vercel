## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the different data when switch date option
- See different page style when click dat/night toggler.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- React
- Scss
- TailwindCss
- Mobile-first workflow
- MUI

### What I learned

This practice helped me strengthen my understanding of React state and grid concepts. To be honest, the time I spent on it wasn't very long. So, I decided to add new features to this project! It looks nice, and completing the day/night pattern taught me a bit about color schemes.

### Continued development

Next time, I will choose a project with concepts that I want to improve, rather than just following a learning path.
